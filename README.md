animation game
1. The minimum features needed for a playable game:
    When the ball touches the board, the score would increase by 100.
    When the board did not catch the ball, the game is over.
2. Features and improvements you would like to add to the game:
    More balls could be added to the game. 
    I could also add these buttons:  "start", "Pause", and "Stop".
   (Actually, if I have some spare time in the future, I want to make something like "Fruit Ninja".)
3. A brief description of how to play the game.
   Player could use the mouse to control the position of the board, only one dimension, though.
   If the board catches the ball, the score would increase by 100.
   If the board did not catches the ball, the game is over.
   You could click anywhere to restart the game.
